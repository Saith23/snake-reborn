# Intro
Well, hello there. This snake game is meant to be a trial and error project for my javascript capabilities. At first, it was private, only a fun little thing I pasted from a tutorial. I decided to try adding more consumables, and suprisingly it worked. Later, I realized the game was garbage, so I revamped the game in just a week, and now I will share it with you all. Happy slithering!
